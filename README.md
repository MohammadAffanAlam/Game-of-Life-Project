# Game-of-Life-Project

This is my first large coding project, as part of my IB computer science class. The project is inspired John Conway's Game of Life. The grid is populated by alive and dead cells. Each generation, a dead cell that has exactly 3 alive neighbors becomes alive, while alive cells that have less than 2 neighbors or more than 3 neighbors become dead. The number of generations and number of alive cells are displayed on the left. The project has a lot of functionaltiy for the user to play around with, including the ability to:

- Pause the grid generations
- Reset the grid
- Change the size of the grid
- Adjust the interval between each generation between 250 milliseconds and 1000 milliseconds
- Change the color of alive cells and dead cells
- Create a save file
- Load a Game of Life state from a save file
